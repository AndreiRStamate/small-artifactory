## Key Features

- **Lightweight and Simple:** Designed for minimal resource consumption and straightforward operation.
- **Effortless Setup:** Quick and easy installation process.
- **Versatile Artifact Support:** Accommodates diverse artifact types.
- **Public Accessibility via ngrok:** Facilitates easy sharing and access through a publicly accessible URL.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following software is installed on your system:

1. **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher. Verify your installation:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```
2. **pip**: The Python package installer. Confirm its availability:
   ```bash
   pip --version
   ```
3. **ngrok**: A utility for exposing local servers to the internet.  
   - Download and install it from the [official ngrok website](https://ngrok.com/download).  
   - Ensure the `ngrok` executable is in your system's PATH. Verify the installation:
     ```bash
     ngrok version
     ```

## Application Usage

### Starting the Application

1. **For macOS Users**: Use the provided `.command` script for a seamless startup:
   ```bash
   ./start-artifactory.command
   ```
   This script will:
   - Start the Flask development server at `http://localhost:6969`.
   - Launch ngrok to create a public URL for the local server.
   - Redirect application logs to `server.log`.

2. **Manual Startup**: Alternatively, start the application directly:
   ```bash
   python3 run_server.py
   ```

3. **Access the Application**:
   - **Local Access**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:6969`.
   - **Public Access**: Use the public URL generated by ngrok (displayed in the terminal).

---

### Stopping the Application

To gracefully terminate the application, use the `.command` script:
```bash
./stop-artifactory.command
```
This script will shut down both the Flask server and the ngrok process.

### Uploading JSON Files

The project includes a convenience script for uploading JSON files:
```bash
./upload-all-json.command
```
This script is designed to showcase a potential use case by working with the [expertbet](https://github.com/AndreiRStamate/expertbet) repository. It retrieves cached JSON files from the `football`, `basketball`, and `hockey` directories in the `expertbet` project and uploads them to the artifactory.

However, you are not limited to this script. You can upload any JSON file to the artifactory by sending an HTTP POST request to the designated upload endpoint. For example:
```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@your-file.json" http://localhost:6969/your-endpoint/upload
```
> **Note**: Replace `/your-endpoint/upload` with the actual upload endpoint defined in the application.
